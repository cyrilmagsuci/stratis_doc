Stratis Unity 3D SDK
####################

Developed by Unity Technologies, Unity is a cross-platform game engine
with a built-in IDE and is used to create video games for web plugins,
consoles, desktop platforms, and mobile devices.

Stratis Unity SDK allows the STRAX Token to be used in game creation as well as the InterFlux Hub, opening up a world of possibilities through Stratis Smart Contracts written in C#.

Non-Fungible Tokens "NFTs" are of special relevance to game developers
that want to include in-game currency. By implementing an NFT, in-game
things can be truly held by the player, eliminating the possibility of
losing acquired things due to lost login credentials or account
termination.

Blockchain is a perfect fit for gaming, and now that blockchain and crypto currencies have hit the mainstream, platforms like the Stratis has introduced are likely to attract a substantial number of developers.
In addition, some of the earliest opposition that cryptos found was due to the fact that they are a form of digital money that competes with fiat currency.

Stratis Blockchain Technologies expanded Unity 3D support to include a light wallet and SDK for Stratis Blockchain Technologies. This achievement enables both the STRAX Token to be supported within game
development and the InterFlux Hub, enabling endless use-cases through the utilization of Stratis Smart Contracts in C#.
